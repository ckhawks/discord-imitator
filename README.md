# discord-imitator
Chooses random people from a Discord server, uses machine learning to generate things that they would say, and then imitates them. All in good fun.

This is currently a private bot, but you can contact @Stellaric#0001 if you're interested in using it.

## Setup
Put your [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) into `config.json.default`, and then rename the file `config.json.default` to `config.json`.

## Commands & Functionality
`~talk` - forces the bot to say something.
The bot will also respond to mentions and pings to the imitating user and their roles.

`~forcechange` - chooses a new person at random from the server to imitate.
